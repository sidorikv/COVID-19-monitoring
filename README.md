Okay, so this bot from telegram who just monitoring difficult situation

V2.0
-Perhaps the most coveted feature added: D
Now, when the update comes out and you have the old version, when you select any country or world, you receive a notification that the version of your bot is out of date, and asks to update the bot using the button at the very bottom.

-6 new countries added.

-The functionality of the "Update bot" button has been redone. Now you just need to click on it and do not need to enter anything.
